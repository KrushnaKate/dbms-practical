create a row-level trigger for the STUDENT table that would get executed by the DML
statement like UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE on that table. The trigger will compute and
show the age difference between current and previous values.

CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);


DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER calculate_age_difference
AFTER INSERT ON STUDENT
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DECLARE prev_age INT;
    
    -- Retrieve the previous age from the table
    SELECT age INTO prev_age
    FROM STUDENT
    WHERE student_id = NEW.student_id - 1;

    -- Calculate the age difference
    IF prev_age IS NOT NULL THEN
        SET @age_diff = NEW.age - prev_age;
    ELSE
        SET @age_diff = NULL;
    END IF;
END //
DELIMITER ;


INSERT INTO STUDENT (student_id, student_name, age) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 20),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 22),
(3, 'Michael Johnson', 25);


INSERT INTO STUDENT (student_id, student_name, age) VALUES
(4, 'Emily Williams', 24);



SELECT @age_diff AS AgeDifference;
